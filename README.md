# UPR
UPR is a Kerbal Space Program "mod". Really it's a bunch of config files and module manager patches but it's goal is to make a complete integrated mod experience for ksp.

This means it integrates some selected mods together to create a system which is universal (i.e same UI, Resources and converters for all systems)

The design concept is for it to be a Semi-realistic easyish stock looking and balanced game

## Developmental notes
This seems like a lot and it is. But this started as trying to get some of my favorite ksp mods to fit seamlessly together and separately trying to make them a little bit more realistic. Then it got all lump together into what currently is UPR. Thus it really should have another name but it was separate "mods" so i just kept one name that had a short acronym: UPR
