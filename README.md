# UPR
UPR (Unique Planetary Resources)

Is a Kerbal Space program "mod". Really it's a bunch of config files and module manager patches but it's goal is to make a complete intergrated mod experince for ksp.

This means it intergrates some selected mods togther to create a system which is universal (i.e same UI, Resouces and converters for all systems)

The desgin concept is for it to be a Semi-realistic easyish stock looking and balanced game

## Developmental notes
This seems like a lot and it is. But this started as trying to get some of my favorite ksp mods to fit seamlessly togeather and sepratly trying to make them a little bit more realistic. Then it got all lump togther into what currently is UPR. Thus it realy should have another name but it was seprate "mods" so i just kept one name that had a short acronym: UPR
